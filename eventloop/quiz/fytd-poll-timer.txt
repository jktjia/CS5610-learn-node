- Explain the order of execution in terms of the event loop for eventloop/poll_timer.js.
- Will the order of execution change if the delay in the while loop is changed from 10s to 150s? Why or why not?
- Will the order of execution change if timeout is changed to 0? Why or why not?

The setTimeout function gets put in the event loop and needs to wait for 100ms
to happen. The asyncOperation function is called in the poll phase and then the 
callback of that is put in the pending callbacks. At this point the timer isn't
done, so the callback is executed, and then after the timer is up the function
in setTimeout executes.

The order of execution will not change if the delay in the while loop is changed 
because the order of the queue will not change (because the time it takes to read
the file is what matters for when the callback is added to the queue).

The order of execution will change if the delay in the timeout is changed to 0
because the timer will be up before the event loop gets to the pending callbacks.
