- Explain the order of execution in terms of the event loop for eventloop/immediate.js.
- Will the order of execution change if timeout is changed to 0? Why or why not?

Tthe console logs happen in the callback for readFile, so logging the data happens first,
followed by setting a timer for 10 ms, and then logging the immediate thing. Then the timer
runs out and logs the thing in the timeout during the timer phase. Changing the amount of
time for the timeout wouldn't change that order because everything else happens in the same
pending callback phase where the timer is queued.
