- In eventloop/poll.js, what will be the order of execution? Briefly explain the order of execution w.r.t the event loop phases.

The async operation function with readFile will run in the poll phase, but it won't log anything 
to the console until the event loop gets to pending callbacks. The other things will run as soon 
as we get to them (in the poll phase), so the order will be:

foo
log 'done' to console
the read file thing
