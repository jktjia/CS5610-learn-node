- In eventloop/timer.js, what will be the order of execution? Briefly explain the order of execution w.r.t the event loop phases.

foo
baz
foo
baz
2 : bar
1 : bar

When foo is called it logs 'foo' to the console, sets a timeout to log 
'{some input} : bar', and then logs 'baz' to the console. The timeouts
don't happen until the event loop gets to them, so the console logs 'foo' 
'bar' for each call of loop (in the poll phase) and then the console logs 
in the things that were timed out in the timer phase.
